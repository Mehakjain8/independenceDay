      <font size="4" face="Calibri">For almost two centuries the Britishers ruled over us. And the citizen of the country
      suffered a lot due to these oppressors. British officials treat us like slaves until we manage to fight back
      against them.We struggled for our independence but work tirelessly and selflessly under the guidance of our
      leaders Jawahar Lal Nehru, Subhash Chandra Bose, Mahatma Gandhi, Chandra Shekhar Azad, and Bhagat Singh. Some of
      these leaders choose the path of violence while some choose non-violence. But the ultimate aim of these was to
      drive out the Britishers from the country. And on 15th August 1947, the long-awaited dream come true.To relive the
      moment and to enjoy the spirit of freedom and independence we celebrate Independence Day. Another reason is to
      remember the sacrifices and lives we have lost in this struggle. Besides, we celebrated it to remind us that this
      freedom that we enjoy is earned the hard way.Apart from that, the celebration wakes up the patriot inside us.
      Along with celebration, the young generation is acquainted with the struggles of the people who lived at that
      time.Although it’s a national holiday the people of the country celebrate it with great enthusiasm. Schools,
      offices, societies, and colleges celebrate this day by organizing various small and big events.Every year at Red
      Fort the Prime Minister of India host the national flag. In the honor of the occasion, 21 gunshots are fired. This
      is the begging of the main event. This event is later on followed by an army parade.The school and colleges
      organize cultural events, fancy dress competitions, speech, debate, and quiz competition.Every Indian holds a
      different viewpoint about Indian Independence. For some, it’s a reminder of the long struggle while for youngsters
      it stands for the glory and honor of the country. Above all, we can see the feeling of patriotism across the
      country.The Indian’s celebrate Independence Day with a feeling of nationalism and patriotism across the country.
      On this day every citizen echoes with festive feeling and pride in the diversity and unity of the people. It’s not
      only a celebration of Independence but also of the unity in diversity of the country.</font>
